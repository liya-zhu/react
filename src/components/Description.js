      <h3>I'M AN 18-YEAR-OLD TRAINING TO BE AN ENTREPRENEUR</h3>
      <p>
        My vision is to solve neglected problems in the world at scale!
        Currently, I'm excited about how to balance economic and environmental
        sustainability. On the side, I'm ALWAYS learning. ðŸ˜… About soft skills,
        philosophy, coding, nature... anything I find! Currently, I'm an intern
        at Terra Optima Labs (a startup researching regenerative agriculture). I
        also have some podcasts (The Knowledge Archives, How I Fixed It) where I
        learn from scientists and entrepreneurs! Finally, I'm an alumni from The
        Knowledge Society, an accelerator training future business leaders! I'd
        love to hear from others solving impactful problems! If you want to get
        in touch, here are some useful links:
